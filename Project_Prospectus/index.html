<H3>Topic</h3>
<p>This project will explore factors that may have contributed to COVID-related learning loss by comparing demographic and testing data to identify the communities hardest hit academically by the pandemic.</p>

<h3>Project Description & Goals</h3>
<p>While many researchers and agencies have identified significant skill loss (in the form of lower test scores and performance overall), more nuaced factors may have unequally distributed to these lower acheivement outcomes. Factors this project will explore are:
<li>Location Information (State, Urban/Rural, Population Density)</li>
<li>COVID-Related Government Funding Allocation (Per Student) </li>
<li>Internet/computer access</li>
<li>Race</li>
<li>Family Income</li> 
<li>Family Size</li>
<li>School type(public/private)</li>
<p>The above data will be sourced from US census data, testing data from the National Center for Education Statistics, and the US Treasury.</p>
<p>The visualizations in this project will compare a calculated "Learning Loss" metric with the census/demographic factors listed above. Doing so will help viewers better understand which factors contributed the <em>most</em> to learning loss during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Government funding was allocated to schools across America to address COVID-related infrastructure and learning needs.  By also examining the ratio of government funding to population, this project may expose the effectiveness of these funding efforts. The core goal of this project is to audit the true impact pandemic conditions had on students across America, and ascertain if certain demographic/regional populations were disproportionately negatively impacted.</p>
