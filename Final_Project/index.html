    <h1>Examining student performance changes during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
    <h4>A visual analysis of <em>4th grade mathematics</em> test scores of public school students pre-COVID (2019) and post-COVID (2022).</h4>
    <br>
    <p>The below graphs and charts are a tool for viewers to better understand the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on student performance. This analysis focused on 4th grade mathemeatics scores of public school students due to data availability. Note: the scores themselves (ranging from the low to mid-200's) are based on the  National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)'s internal scoring metric. </p>

    <h2>Hover Map</h2>
    <p>Mathematics score decreases were felt all across the nation. Over 94% of US States experienced worse test scores in 2022 than in 2019. Hover over the states to see what each state's "Learning Loss" metric was. </p>
    <p>LearningLossMetric = <em>2019 Average Score</em> - <em>2022 Average Score</em></p>

    <h2>A Closer Look at Funding</h2>
    <p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government allocated $189.5 billion of funding to states to support the infrastructure for remote/hybrid learning and to address "Learning Loss" due to the unstable learning enviornment from 2020-2021. </p>
    <p>This scatter plot's hover feature exposes state-by-state COVID relief funding per capita, the state's average learning loss, and the percentage of the state's allocation that has been utilized.
