    <h1>Examining student performance changes during the COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
    <h4>A visual analysis of <em>4th grade mathematics</em> test scores of public school students pre-COVID (2019) and post-COVID (2022).</h4>

    <h1>Hover Map</h1>
    <p>Each state experienced worse test scores in 2022 than in 2019. Hover over the states to see what the state's "Learning Loss" metric was. </p>
    <p>LearningLossMetric = <em>2019 Average Score</em> - <em>2022 Average Score</em></p>

    <h1>Explore A State</h1>
   
    <p>Each state had different outcomes. Select a state using the dropdown menu to explore the state's scores from 2019 to 2022, as well as how different demographics fared.</p>

    <h1>A Closer Look at Funding</h1>
    <p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government allocated $189.5 billion of funding to states to support the infrastructure for remote/hybrid learning and to address "Learning Loss" due to the unstable learning enviornment from 2020-2021. </p>
    <p>Use this scatter plot's hover feature to explore state-by-state COVID relief funding and see if states that had lower per capita
      funding or a lower percentage of utilized funds had worse outcomes than states with higher per
      capita funding and better utilization.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p><em>Testing and “Learning Loss” Data</em></p>
    <p>The testing data will be sourced from the Nation’s Report Card, a report on the National
        Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a standardized assessment developed and
        administered by National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), within the U.S. Department of
        Education and the Institute of Education Sciences (IES). You can learn more about the Nation’s
        Report Card <a href = "https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/about.aspx#:~:text=The%20National%20Assessment%20of%20Educational,reading%2C%20science%2C%20and%20writing.">here</a> and can explore the data available <a href ="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/landing">here.</a></p>
    <p><em>Funding Data</em></p>
    <p>As a part of the government response to COVID, funds were set aside to assist schools in
        transitioning to remote learning and make in-person classrooms safer to mitigate the uncertain
        learning environment. To investigate how effectively funds were allocated and used, I will be
        using data from the US Department of Education’s Education Stabilization Fund, which you can
        explore <a href = "https://covid-relief-data.ed.gov/?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=">here.</a></p>
